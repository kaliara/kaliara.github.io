My first attempt at making a Framer component!

The Delay component lets you show a spinner for a configurable number of seconds, and then switches to its contents. Handy for prototyping look-and-feel of a loading sequence.

Unfortunately spinner isn't currently customizable beyond the color. We need support for multiple child slots!
